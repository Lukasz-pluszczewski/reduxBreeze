Library to make managing state, actionCreators, reducers in you redux application a breeze. You can finally stop copyPasting and start actually coding! :)

## FAQ
##### Why this exists?
Redux is really great! It allows you to have whole application state in one, easily accessible state and manage it in a predictable way. All is good... until you application is getting bigger and you write tens or even hundreds of same reducer cases and action creators. You start thinking: "that's a lot of work a computer is perfect at: copying stuff around"

**Exactly!**

#### Are there good alternatives? 
Let me know if you find one.

#### I found a bug! What should I do?
There are at least 3 options:
1. Add an issue, write test(s) for bug you found, write fix that will make your test(s) pass, submit pull request
2. Add an issue, write test(s) for bug you found, submit pull request with you test(s)
3. Add an issue

All contributions are appreciated!
